# SwiduxRouter
Router driven by Swidux store.

## Stability

This library should be considered alpha, and not stable. Breaking changes will happen often.

## Known issues

- SwiftPM support is broken until we can add dependency on UIKit.
-  `NavigationBar` back button don't use Swidux store (this is why `NavigationBar` is currently hidden by default).

## License

SwiduxRouter is released under the MIT license. See [LICENSE](LICENSE]) for details.
